            <em>
                One mental leap that I had to make is the difference between "timeline" (or "news feed") feeds and regular old "profile" (or "user") feeds. They're all feeds, but "timeline" feeds follow "profile" feeds - "profile" feeds <strong>do not</strong> follow other "profile" feeds.
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>
                Each "user" should have 2 feeds: their own "profile" feed (which is just the activities that they post to their profile) and a separate "timeline" feed (which follows other user's "profile" feeds).
